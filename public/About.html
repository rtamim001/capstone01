        <p>Hello! My name is Tamim Rahman, and I am an Honours 1st-year Chemistry student at Kabi Nazrul Government College, affiliated with the 7 Colleges of Dhaka University. My academic focus is on Physical Chemistry, and I love diving into the complexities of science.</p>
        
        <p>Outside academics, I enjoy watching TV series and listening to music. These hobbies help me relax and recharge, giving me the energy to stay curious and creative in my learning journey.</p>
        
        <p>Recently, I’ve been exploring web development and have learned HTML5. I’m currently working on a capstone project to combine my technical skills with my passion for chemistry and education. This is just the beginning of my exciting journey in science and technology!</p>
